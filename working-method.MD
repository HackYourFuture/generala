# How to Collaborate on code

* Everybody has to work in **HackYourFuture/generala**
* When a developer wants to fix a bug or make a feature you have to make a new feature branch and make the changes in that
* Then developer should merge `development` into the feature branch
* Test the change on the feature branch
* If it's ok, put the task to review in Taiga
* When the review is accepted you have to merge your branch back into `development`
